 * Have a shortcut option on every complex item in a FancyItemsMixin based plugin

 * Allow configuration of autopaste klemmbrett wide, plugin wide for FancyItemsMixin
   based plugins, or on a per items basis for FancyItemsMixin based plugin
 * Allow actions to behave like snippets in regard to the callable feature, so we can
   take the text from the clipboard, transform it with the callable, and then pass it
   to an action
 * Should we just use "text in self.top" for extend-detection in HistoryPicker?
 * Should we be able to configure detection-method? "in", "start,end", "start" etc?
